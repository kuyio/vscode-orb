3. Select "Install from VSIX..." from the ellipsis menu (`...`) at the top right of the Extensions view.
4. In the file dialog that appears, navigate to the location where you have saved the `.vsix` file and select it.
5. Click "Install" to install the extension.
6. After installation, you may need to reload Visual Studio Code for the extension to take effect
